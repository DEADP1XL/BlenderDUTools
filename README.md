# BlenderDUTools
Blender Add-On to Prepare Models for .obj Export to Dual Universe for Projectors

# Process
Automatically sets normals to faces (for optimal in-game shading) and optionally applies a Wireframe Modifier with a default 0.125m thickness.

# Install:
Add to Blender via Edit -> Preferences -> Add-Ons -> Install

# Usage:
1. Select all items to be prepared for export
2. Choose Prep as Wireframe or Prep as Solid Model button from the DU Tools panel in the sidebar (hide/show with 'N' key by default)
3. Export to .obj as usual (I recommend setting it to only export selection, and not to use materials).
